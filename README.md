**Summary**

Prehab4All is an app that displays videos of licensed medical professionals performing stretches as well as mobility and rehabilitation exercises that target certain body parts. The videos will mostly be pulled from Instagram (although we are considering youtube videos in future updates). The exercises and stretches performed are preventative measures to protect against injury, and can be used as daily maintenance to increase mobility and range of motion.The target audience is very wide for this app. It can include any individuals who want to take preventative measures to protect against injury, individuals who live a sedentary lifestyle and have developed some muscular imbalances, and individuals who want to live healthier and improve their posture, mobility, or strength. 

The body parts addressed in the first deployment will include the cervical spine (neck), shoulders, hips, as well as a page for myofascial release. In future versions of the app, we might include the back, hands, and lower extremities. 
All of the videos come from licensed medical professionals (Doctors of Physical Therapy, Doctors of Chiropractic Medicine, Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) who have shared this information publicly on platforms such as Instagram. An advantage of this app is that it takes this relevant medical information that is spread throughout the internet, and categorically organizes it by body region.

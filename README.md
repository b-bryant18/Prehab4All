# Prehab
Prehab is an application for displaying videos of licensed medical professionals performing mobility and physical rehabilitation exercises. Users can select their desired muscle group that they want to focus on, such as the cervical (neck), shoulders, hips, and myofascial groups.
The videos are mostly pulled from Instagram. All of the videos come from licensed medical professionals (Doctors of Physical Therapy, Doctors of Chiropractic Medicine, Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) who have shared this information publicly on platforms such as Instagram. 
Currently there are demonstrational videos all across the internet of people performing exercises, however many of them are incorrect technique and focus more on aesthetics and getting views rather than actual exercise prescription. Many of them are not medically certified. An advantage of this app is that it takes this relevant medical information, centralizes it in one site and categorically organizes it by body region. 
The target audience is very wide for this app. It can include any individuals who want to take preventative measures to protect against injury, individuals who live a sedentary lifestyle and have developed some muscular imbalances, and individuals who want to live healthier and improve their posture, mobility, or strength. 
The value of the Prehab app is to provide users a one stop location for medically reliable physical therapy videos, without encouring weeks/months of cost with physical therapy sessions and co-payments.
